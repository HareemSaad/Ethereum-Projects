# Token Bonded Curve

In this project you will find token bonding curve algorithm for linear (x), exponential (x^y) and polynomial (x^y + z) curves

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/TokenBondingCurve_Ploynomial.ts
npx hardhat run scripts/TokenBondingCurve_Exponential.ts
npx hardhat run scripts/TokenBondingCurve_Linear.ts
forge build
forge test
```
